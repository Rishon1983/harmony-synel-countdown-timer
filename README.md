# Harmony synel countdown timer

Harmony-synel-countdown-timer is a userscript that adds an element with countdown timer working hours.
It shows how many hours you need to work today, as well as the total number of hours for the current month.
The calculation is based on how many hours left or how many hours worked more.

If the shift is not active (not started or finished), you can see only current month hours.

When there is an active shift, the countdown timer will show daily and monthly hours.

You can minimize or drag the countdown timer.

If you did some changes or got an error alert (internet connection etc) - just refresh the page
